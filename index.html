                <p>Hello, I am Yaqi and my favorite animal ever is the ORCA. Orcas are apex predators and have a diverse diet. They are highly social; some populations are composed of highly stable matrilineal family groups (pods). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca">Wikipedia Page</a>. Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as manifestations of animal culture.</p>
